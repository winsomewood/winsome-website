class Comment
  # Comment does not extend ActiveRecord::Base.
  # It is an Active Model instead of an ActiveRecord Model.
  # That means it has some features like attributes &
  # validations, but is not backed by a table in the database.
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html
  #
  # We do this to be able to define a large set of validations
  # using Active Model syntax, then call `valid?` to check if
  # those validations pass
